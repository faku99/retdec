[RetDec](https://retdec.com/) is a retargetable machine-code decompiler based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

The decompiler is not limited to any particular target architecture, operating system, or executable file format:
* Supported file formats: ELF, PE, Mach-O, COFF, AR (archive), Intel HEX, and raw machine code.
* Supported architectures (32b only): Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.

Features:
* Static analysis of executable files with detailed information.
* Compiler and packer detection.
* Loading and instruction decoding.
* Signature-based removal of statically linked library code.
* Extraction and utilization of debugging information (DWARF, PDB).
* Reconstruction of instruction idioms.
* Detection and reconstruction of C++ class hierarchies (RTTI, vtables).
* Demangling of symbols from C++ binaries (GCC, MSVC, Borland).
* Reconstruction of functions, types, and high-level constructs.
* Integrated disassembler.
* Output in two high-level languages: C and a Python-like language.
* Generation of call graphs, control-flow graphs, and various statistics.

## Installation and Use

Currently, we support only Windows (7 or later), Linux, and unofficially macOS.

### Windows

1. Either download and unpack a [pre-built package](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/releases), or build and install the decompiler by yourself (the process is described below):

2. Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

3. Install [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) and other needed applications by following RetDec's [Windows environment setup guide](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment).

3. Now, you are all set to run the decompiler. To decompile a binary file named `test.exe`, run

    ```sh
    bash $RETDEC_INSTALL_DIR/bin/retdec-decompiler.sh test.exe
    ```

   For more information, run `retdec-decompiler.sh` with `--help`.

### Linux

1. There are currently no pre-built packages for Linux. You will have to build and install the decompiler by yourself. The process is described below.

2. After you have built the decompiler, you will need to install the following packages via your distribution's package manager:

    * [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (version >= 4)
    * [UPX](https://upx.github.io/)
    * [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/)

3. Now, you are all set to run the decompiler. To decompile a binary file named `test.exe`, run

    ```sh
    $RETDEC_INSTALL_DIR/bin/retdec-decompiler.sh test.exe
    ```

   For more information, run `retdec-decompiler.sh` with `--help`.

### Process

Note: Although RetDec now supports a system-wide installation ([#94](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/94)), unless you use your distribution's package manager to install it, we recommend installing RetDec locally into a designated directory. The reason for this is that uninstallation will be easier as you will only need to remove a single directory. To perform a local installation, run `cmake` with the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` parameter, where `<path>` is directory into which RetDec will be installed (e.g. `$HOME/projects/retdec-install` on Linux and macOS, and `C:\projects\retdec-install` on Windows).

* Clone the repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec`
* Linux:
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make -jN` (`N` is the number of CPU cores to use for parallel build)
  * `make install`
* Windows:
  * Open a command prompt (e.g. `C:\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd` from [MSYS2](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/wiki/Windows-Environment))
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> -G<generator>`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release -- -m`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release --target install`
  * Alternatively, you can open `retdec.sln` generated by `cmake` in Visual Studio IDE.
* macOS:
  * `cd retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * ```sh
    # Apple ships old Flex & Bison, so Homebrew versions should be used.
    export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/include"
    export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/lib;/usr/local/opt/bison/lib"
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"
    ```
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make -jN` (`N` is the number of CPU cores to use for parallel build)
  * `make install`

You have to pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to set the installation path to `<path>`. Quote the path if you are using backslashes on Windows (e.g. `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\retdec"`).
* (Windows only) `-G<generator>` is `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015"` for 32-bit build using Visual Studio 2015, or `-G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"` for 64-bit build using Visual Studio 2015. Later versions of Visual Studio may be used.

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DRETDEC_DOC=ON` to build with API documentation (requires Doxygen and Graphviz, disabled by default).
* `-DRETDEC_TESTS=ON` to build with tests (disabled by default).
* `-DRETDEC_DEV_TOOLS=ON` to build with development tools (disabled by default).
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build with debugging information, which is useful during development. By default, the project is built in the `Release` mode. This has no effect on Windows, but the same thing can be achieved by running `cmake --build .` with the `--config Debug` parameter.
* `-DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH=<path>` to use Perl at `<path>` (probably useful only on Windows).

## Build in Docker

Docker support is maintained by community. If something does not work for you or if you have suggestions for improvements, open an issue or PR.

### Build Image

Building in Docker does not require installation of the required libraries locally. This is a good option for trying out RetDec without setting up the whole build toolchain.

To build the RetDec Docker image, run
```
docker build -t retdec .
```

This builds the image from the master branch of this repository.

To build the image using the local copy of the repository, use the development Dockerfile, `Dockerfile.dev`:
```
docker build -t retdec:dev . -f Dockerfile.dev
```

### Run Container

If your `uid` is not 1000, make sure that the directory containing your input binary files is accessible for RetDec:
```
chmod 0777 /path/to/local/directory
```
Now, you can run the decompiler inside a container:
```
docker run --rm -v /path/to/local/directory:/destination retdec retdec-decompiler.sh /destination/binary
```
Output files will be generated to the same directory (e.g. `/path/to/local/directory`).
